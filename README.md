# SpamBox Email Component

[:octocat: `A member repository of DSuite`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DSuite/)

🥡️✉️📦️ The SpamBox is an open source separate implementation of the typical email spam folder.

## Usage

This is mainly an in-house component of the [:octocat: `DMail email service`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/DMail/) but is designed to be flexible, and usable by other projects

This project is a spam folder implementation. It is recommended to have a [:octocat: `Tacklebox`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/TackleBox_Email_Component/) above or below the spam folder for phishing emails, as the 2 are different, and need to be in their own category.

> **Note** **This README is a stub and needs expansion**
